### Correlation

This plot reveals a heavy correlation between population and nighttime lights within the Dominican Republic as a whole. One explanation for the result is the country's large urban population, as more people in cities will produce a greater positive correlation with lighting.

This plot illustrates the fitted values of each available variable against the residual data of the regression model. The high r-squared value suggests strong correlation between population and the variables.
## Land Use

## Roads and Health Care
